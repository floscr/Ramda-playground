Playground for Ramda & Ramda-Fantasy
====================================

This is a little boileplate for playing around with [Ramda][] and [Ramda-Fantasy][]

This boilerplate uses [jest][] as a testing framework.

I write simple scripts directly in the `index.spec.js` file and leave jest watch running via the `npm run test:watch` task.

## Scripts

```sh
# Run the the main index file using babel-node
npm run start

# Run your tests once
npm run test

# Watch tests
npm run test:watch
```
